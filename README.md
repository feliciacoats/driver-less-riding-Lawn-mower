# driver-less-riding-Lawn-mower
My idea is a driver-less riding lawn mower that does not require human intervention with navigation, mapping to cut lawns of various sizes, sensors and a vacuum system with a bag attached that cleans up the grass as it is cutting the yard. I think it would be great considering single moms who may be fearful of getting in the yard, sun and heat of 90 degrees, Disable person(s), and elderly people who may not have kids or dependable family members to cut their grass on a routine basis.
